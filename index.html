                    <h2 class="gpt-a-h">The Great Depression</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="gpt-p">The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted through the late 1930s. It started with the stock market crash in October 1929, which wiped out millions of investors and led to a cascade of bank failures and business closures. Unemployment skyrocketed as companies cut back on production and laid off workers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="gpt-p">Agricultural sectors were also heavily impacted, particularly in the United States, where the Dust Bowl exacerbated the plight of farmers. The resulting economic hardship led to widespread poverty and a decline in living standards.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="gpt-p">Governments responded with various measures to stimulate economies, including public works programs and social safety nets. In the U.S., President Franklin D. Rooseveltâ€™s New Deal aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform, fundamentally reshaping the role of government in the economy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="gpt-p">The Great Depression had lasting effects on economic policies and global relations, ultimately paving the way for significant changes in financial regulation and social welfare systems. It is often viewed as a pivotal moment in 20th-century history.</p>
